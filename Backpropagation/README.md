# Backpropagation from Scratch with Python

Backpropagation is a fundamental algorithm for training multi-layer feedforward neural networks, lying at the heart of many modern deep learning frameworks. It operates in two main phases to optimize network weights for accurate predictions. During the forward pass, input data flows through the network, layer by layer, until it generates output classifications. The backward pass then takes center stage, where the algorithm assesses the performance by calculating the loss function's gradient. This gradient information, coupled with the chain rule of calculus, guides the systematic adjustment of weights across the network. Through iterative application, backpropagation fine-tunes the network's weights, enhancing its ability to model complex relationships and make accurate predictions.
