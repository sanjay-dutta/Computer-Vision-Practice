# Flower Image Classification using Vision Transformer (ViT)

### Introduction

In the realm of image classification, the Vision Transformer (ViT) stands out as a groundbreaking architecture that redefines how we approach computer vision tasks. By leveraging the Transformer model, originally designed for natural language processing, ViT processes images as sequences of patches, offering a compelling alternative to traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In this tutorial, we will walk through the implementation of ViT for classifying flower images into five categories: daisy, dandelion, roses, sunflowers, and tulips. This guide will provide you with the knowledge and tools needed to harness the power of ViT for image classification tasks.
