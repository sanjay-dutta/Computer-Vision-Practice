# Object Detection in a Video
This project showcased the implementation of Haar Cascade classifiers for object detection in video streams. Haar Cascades are a popular method for object detection due to their efficiency and effectiveness, particularly in detecting faces and other predefined objects. Using OpenCV, this project demonstrates how to apply Haar Cascades to real-time video data to identify and track objects.
