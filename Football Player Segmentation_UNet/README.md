# Football Player Segmentation with U-Net

This script is a comprehensive example of a deep learning workflow designed to perform image segmentation using TensorFlow and the U-Net architecture. The script is divided into several distinct sections, each fulfilling specific roles in the data handling, processing, and modeling pipeline. Let's break down each part to understand its function:

- 1. Importing Libraries
The script begins by importing necessary Python libraries:

os, numpy, json, zipfile for file and data manipulation.
matplotlib.pyplot for plotting, pandas and seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
tensorflow for building and training deep learning models, and related modules for processing.
PIL for image operations, sklearn for model evaluation tools.
- 2. Setting Constants and Paths
Seed for reproducibility: Ensures that the results are the same each time the script is run.
INPUT_SIZE, IMG_SIZE, N: Define the dimensions for image processing and the number of images to process.
Path settings: Define where to find the images and annotations related to the dataset.
- 3. Loading and Processing Data
Loading JSON Annotations: The script reads a JSON file which contains metadata about the images.
Creating a dictionary of image IDs and filenames: Facilitates access to each image by its identifier.
Loading and resizing images: Images are loaded and resized to a standard dimension (IMG_SIZE) for consistent processing.
- 4. Initial Visualization
Displaying images: A grid of the first 9 images is created to visually inspect the data before any processing.
- 5. Creating Masks from Annotations
Generating masks: For the first annotation, a mask is created by drawing polygons (segmentations) that are specified in the JSON file. This process is repeated for all annotations to create a mask for each image.
- 6. Preparing Data for Model Training
Splitting data: The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
Print shapes: Displays the shape of the training and testing datasets for confirmation.
- 7. Defining the U-Net Model
Model functions: Functions are defined to create the U-Net architecture:
conv_block: Builds the convolutional blocks used in the contracting path of the U-Net.
upsampling_block: Constructs the upsampling blocks for the expansive path.
unet_model: Assembles the entire U-Net model using the previously defined blocks.
- 8. Model Compilation and Training
Compiling the model: The U-Net model is compiled with an optimizer, loss function, and metrics.
Training the model: The model is trained on the dataset, and its performance is monitored on a validation set.
- 9. Evaluating the Model
Model evaluation: The trained model is evaluated on the test set.
Prediction and visualization: The model predicts masks for the test images, and these predicted masks are visualized alongside the original images and true masks.
Saving visual results: The comparison of the original images, true masks, and predicted masks is saved as an image file for later review.
- 10. Classification Report
Generating a report: A classification report is generated to provide detailed performance metrics (e.g., precision, recall) for the model on the test data.
