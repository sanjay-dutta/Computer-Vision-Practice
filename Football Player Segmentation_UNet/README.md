# Football Player Segmentation with U-Net

Let's break down the script into its key components and describe each section in detail, maintaining the original subsections as outlined in your request. This will help clarify how each part of the code contributes to the overall task of image segmentation using deep learning.

1. Importing Libraries
   import os
import numpy as np
import json
import zipfile
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow.keras.layers as tfl
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
tf.random.set_seed(221) # for reproducible results

This block imports all the necessary Python libraries required for the script:

os, numpy, json, zipfile are used for handling files and data manipulation.
matplotlib.pyplot, pandas, seaborn are used for data analysis and plotting.
tensorflow and its submodules are used for building and training the neural network model.
PIL for image manipulation tasks.
sklearn provides tools for splitting the dataset and evaluating the model performance.

2. Setting Constants and Paths
INPUT_SIZE = (1920, 1080)
IMG_SIZE = 512 # image size for the network
N = 512
path = ''
image_path = os.path.join(path, '/impacs/sad64/SLURM/Football Player Segmentation/dataset/images')
mask_path = os.path.join(path, '/impacs/sad64/SLURM/Football Player Segmentation/dataset/annotations')

Here, the script sets several constants related to how images will be handled:

INPUT_SIZE and IMG_SIZE define the dimensions for processing images.
N is the number of images to process.
image_path and mask_path specify the directories where the images and their corresponding annotations are stored.
